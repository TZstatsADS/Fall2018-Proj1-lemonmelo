I think other people are going to say this, but it's true.  Seeing this HIT be available again is a bit of a happiness.  I am a casual Turker that can go for weeks or months without doing any jobs.  The reason for that is I get turned off by a lack of good jobs that are not tedious jobs that ask dozens of questions with little compensation.  When I see good jobs like this one, it does motivate me to do other jobs.  I do like the idea of furthering science and related fields.  The (social?) science related jobs like this one are more meaningful than the jobs that ask you to go go google and search for stuff.  Furthermore, if the RIT in the requester name stands for "Rochester Institute of Technology" then you and I have something in common.  I'm a RIT alumnus and have been working there on staff for 20+ years.  If you are part of the same RIT, then it is even better that I'm helping out a fellow member of the RIT community.  It you're not part of the same RIT, that's cool as well.  Happy to help.

Happiness, a main goal of modern life, undeniable becomes the biggest concern of the world. An increasing number of people pay more attention on that ones job or social life which has more influences on our happiness. Different people have view this issue in different angle. Nevertheless, I hold the idea that both my job and social life are important to my happiness and both of them serve indispensable functions.

To begin with, a secure job meets my fundamental demands. With a job, I can receive payment, which supports my personal expenses such as paying for a meal, purchasing a fashion dress, renew my apartment and so forth. All these are the security to ensure my independent life and the source of freedom and happiness. Without a job, it is impossible for me to live a happy life. In this case, indeed, my job enjoys a vital impact on my happiness.

Furthermore, social life, also a necessary part of modern life, has a profound effect on everyone. As far as Iam concerned, social life contains that keeping an inmate relationship with friends, family and co-workers. It would be hard to imagine if one have a terrible social life or even have no social life, how out-dated he or she will be and how tedious his or her life will be. Every year, I will spend my holidays traveling with my friends and family during which we can take beautiful photos and share private life stories with each other. These unforgettable memories are my lifelong measures and bring me endless happiness.

To sum up, my job and my social life serve as different benefits. And they are equally important and both beneficial to my happiness. My job meets the needs and expenses of my daily life, providing sufficient physical fundaments which are the security of a happy life. In addition, my social life allows me to keep a harmony relationship with friends and family and brings a source of happiness. In turn, both my job.

Well, what made you leave your old job in the first place? Whatever the reason, it is most likely still there and not going to change any time soon. Considering that, it sounds to me that you are right in thinking this won't be a wise decision in the long term. Think about how hard, unfair and embarrassing it might be for you to quit a job you returned to after 3 months, for the second time. You should only go back if you are absolutely 100% sure you are going to stick at your old job for a least another year, if not more. If that thought makes you miserable - don't go back. Cause you won't be able to leave in a dignified way.

Happiness, a main goal of modern life, undeniable becomes the biggest concern of the world. An increasing number of people pay more attention on that one's job or social life which has more influences on our happiness. Different people have view this issue in different angle. Nevertheless, I hold the idea that both my job and social life are important to my happiness and both of them serve indispensable functions.

To begin with, a secure job meets my fundamental demands. With a job, I can receive payment, which supports my personal expenses such as paying for a meal, purchasing a fashion dress, renew my apartment and so forth. All these are the security to ensure my independent life and the source of freedom and happiness. Without a job, it is impossible for me to live a happy life. In this case, indeed, my job enjoys a vital impact on my happiness.

Furthermore, social life, also a necessary part of modern life, has a profound effect on everyone. As far as I'm concerned, social life contains that keeping an inmate relationship with friends, family and co-workers. It would be hard to imagine if one have a terrible social life or even have no social life, how out-dated he or she will be and how tedious his or her life will be. Every year, I will spend my holidays traveling with my friends and family during which we can take beautiful photos and share private life stories with each other. These unforgettable memories are my lifelong measures and bring me endless happiness.

To sum up, my job and my social life serve as different benefits. And they are equally important and both beneficial to my happiness. My job meets the needs and expenses of my daily life, providing sufficient physical fundaments which are the security of a happy life. In addition, my social life allows me to keep a harmony relationship with friends and family and brings a source of happiness. In turn, both my job.
