For this day's free reading we prepared: Harry Potter, Animal Farm, and Wuthering Heights.

Happiness is not solely derived from external, momentary pleasures.[16] Indeed, despite the popular conception that happiness is fleeting, studies suggest that happiness is actually rather stable over time.[17][18] Happiness is partly genetically based.[19][20] Based on twin studies, 50 percent of a given human's happiness level is genetically determined, 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation, and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self-control.[21]

My old school is an unforgettable place for me because I have lived the best years of my life in it. I had a lot of friends, and I was taught by great teachers. So I would like to share with you everything I remember about my old school. 

My school was ordinary school. What makes it special is the feeling one can experience as he would enter the front door of the school. The loud voices of the students laughing, screaming, and chatting is all what you can hear before the bell ranges.

Usually first classes are the worst. Students find themselves sleepy and lazy it's the classes which I take advantage of to stare everywhere in the classroom. The first thing that could be observed at my classroom is the stunning graphic design by my classmate Layla which occupying the left corner of the classroom. The hardwood table is in the right corner. we usually gather around the table for reading 'free reading' as I like to call it. For this day's free reading we prepared: Harry Potter, Animal Farm, and Wuthering Heights.

As you first walk into the vast yard of my old school a feeling of hunger will attack your stomach. A scent that you have never smelled begins to enter your lunges. It is a sort of smell that convinces you that you must eat in the school cafeteria. Hajer is the cafeteria cook, and she was an excellent cook.

My best teacher told me once: ' the best places are the places that we don't feel how amazing they were except when we leave them'. That what happened to me eventually because I never knew how great Hajer the cook is, or how joyful the free hours reading was except when I left my old school.
what made me really happy was passing my classes.

Until I finished my college, I was kind of a newborn lady, who had never visited any places without her places of her local area. After I got admitted into the college, I started exploring the world and the amazing things that invite people like us. One day I planned with my friends that we would visit International trade fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others but to me, that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on, we did as we thought and finalised our visit to the fair. After break period at college, we escaped by the back door (As a side note, I would like to mention that Iad no previous record of escaping school or college before). We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasnat enough space to sit on the back side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us. Thatas why with a fishy smile we took the decision that one of us would sit in front of the baby taxi with the taxi driver. It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it.
Getting a job after i graduate because its simple; i get to have more money.
I accepted financial aid for this upcoming school year through my school's website.
