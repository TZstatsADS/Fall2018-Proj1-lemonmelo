Nostalgia has me by the throat today. Iam not sure why. In an effort to assuage it, I am sifting through old photos and there are some great ones from a holiday a few years ago. I had gone on a family holiday with my parents and two siblings to Munnar in the tea country of Kerala. We drove from Kottayam to Munnar and stayed for a weekend. That trip too was steeped in nostalgia as my father had grown up there.

When the three of us were little kids, our favorite bedtime stories were the 'Munar Talesa narrated with infectious enthusiasm by my father. We were never satisfied with one and would try to wheedle more by pleading hard. His yarns portrayed what seemed to be an idyllic country life to the three of us who lived in a flat in Bombay in those days. There were tales of runaway cows, gardening attempts, going to school in the cold winter and throwing up on long bus journeys down from the hills. Munnar always seemed like a little piece of heaven to me. Around the time my father went away to college, my grandfather relocated to our hometown of Kottayam following his retirement. My father didnt return for more than thirty years in fear of tainting his cherished memories. He finally gave in when the rest of his siblings planned a trip to see if their old house, school and other favorite places were still there.
Munnar still seems a lovely town to me if you stay away from the crowded and badly constructed main areas. But my father insists that it was much better sixty years ago when the British company Messrs Finlay Muir & Co ran the town. The town had grown due to the tea estates owned by Finlay Muir in the name of Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. From electricity generation to hospitals, everything was set up and managed by the company but he remembers it to be an extremely well-run town. Even the roads were washed down everyday, he says. The company also ran the school where my granddad was the Headmaster and that my father attended. He recalls the Munnar Supply Association (MSA) being a shop for the British with many imported things that seemed exotic to him like cheese and preserves. We went in to take a look on that trip but there was nothing remotely exotic in there.
Last year my parents came along on a location visit to Munnar to add properties for seek&hide. We stayed at one of our favourite homestays in Munnar, Casa del Fauno and were lucky that we caught both the glorious sunset and sunrise over a steep valley. My father looked so content and happy to be back in Munnar. The next day we visited another of our hotels in Munnar, Windermere Estate. The manager mentioned that the great grandson of James Finlay had stayed with them a while ago. So we were not the only people who were making nostalgic trips to Munnar :) If you look at these pictures, it will be clear why I am a wee bit sentimental about the place too.

Having the feeling of losing a loved one is something that everyone eventually experiences. Losing my grandpa in a car accident is by far the most devastating thing I had to learn to cope with. My grandpa and I were really close. We did many things together until the day somebody decided to have a drink while driving behind the wheel. Not only did the drunk driver pay dearly for his senseless act. He also took my grandfather's life when he collided into the side of his car.
             Though my grandfather's death was five years ago, I still remember him. An image of him is still locked in my mind, but my memories of him are faint. After breakfast on Saturdays, we would play in the park and feed the ducks. I would hold my grandpaas hand and I remember how his hands felt very much like paper, yet very callused from long years of hard work. When it rained out, he baked me fudge brownies and cookies. My grandpa was always there when I needed a wound to be tended to or when I was sick and not feeling well. I miss my grandpa dearly with all my heart, and I wish I could tell him now how much I miss everything we used to do together.

Many people take this week off from work and school to spend time with their families. The holidays are a good time to strengthen our connections and renew relationships. So turn off the cell phones, computers and televisions and take time to focus on your family.
  Research shows that families who spend time together are strong families. They communicate better and share a sense of belonging. Here are a few ideas you can try to spend time with your family.
     * Family game night. Spend at least one night during the holidays with the TV off and the family huddled together to play a favorite game. You may play cards, bingo or any other family favorite. Consider continuing this practice throughout the year and designate at least one night per week as family game night.
     * Go for a walk. After eating rich holiday foods, taking a walk provides not only time together but a great way to get some exercise.
     * Movie night. Rent a movie or watch a TV holiday special, pop some popcorn, and kick back for some family fun. Like game night, this may be something you'd like to continue throughout the year as a way to spend time together.
     * Play outdoors together. You can ride bikes, play ball, or go for a hike. Itall give the entire family some fresh air, exercise and great fun.
     * Go shopping. Hang out together while shopping at the after Christmas sales.
      * Cook together. Parents and kids can do the holiday baking and food preparation together. Even the youngest children can wash vegetables, set the table, or ice cookies.
     * Spend some one-on-one time with each child if you have more than one. Spending time alone provides time to bond with the child and helps him gain a sense of belonging and feeling of importance. It also provides an opportunity for the two of you to get to know each other better.
     * Since grandparents and older family members usually visit during the holidays, take time to share family customs and tell stories about past generations. Families build strength when they share family customs and traditions give family members a sense of belonging, and they strengthen values and beliefs. 
     One of the greatest gifts of the holiday season is the gift of time with family. Spend time together to strengthen relationships and to make wonderful family memories. Strong families spend time with each other - quality time in large quantities. So begin during the holidays and continue making time for each other throughout the year.

Watching the sun rise, getting a raise, putting a smile on someone's face these are all examples of when a person may feel a happy. They are all diverse, just like the individual's in the world. Happiness is acquired through countless stimuli, whether they are material or emotional. One can not give a general definition for happiness, due to the fact that each person has their own perception of what happiness is. Happiness lies in the eye of the beholder, and as the beholder I see happiness as:Thus through this essay I will describe what happiness means to me, by discussing the above mentioned.

Having the feeling of losing a loved one is something that everyone eventually experiences. Losing my grandpa in a car accident is by far the most devastating thing I had to learn to cope with. My grandpa and I were really close. We did many things together until the day somebody decided to have a drink while driving behind the wheel. Not only did the drunk driver pay dearly for his senseless act. He also took my grandfather's life when he collided into the side of his car.
             Though my grandfather's death was five years ago, I still remember him. An image of him is still locked in my mind, but my memories of him are faint. After breakfast on Saturdays, we would play in the park and feed the ducks. I would hold my grandpa's hand and I remember how his hands felt very much like paper, yet very callused from long years of hard work. When it rained out, he baked me fudge brownies and cookies. My grandpa was always there when I needed a wound to be tended to or when I was sick and not feeling well. I miss my grandpa dearly with all my heart, and I wish I could tell him now how much I miss everything we used to do together.

The event and the celebration both took place in our house which is in Danville.

As soon as my father affirmed that we would celebrate this very special day, every one of our family got busy for the arrangement. My parents went to invite guests and to do some necessary shopping. I was so happy and excited that I also called some of my friends to enjoy the event. I wanted to be near the newborn baby all the time and when my mother told me to give some time to the mother and baby alone, I felt quite sad and depressed. I could not believe that such a beautiful baby is my nephew and I wanted to touch him and play with him all the time. However, the sad feeling was so momentary in this case and I forgot it in few minutes. Then I started playing and gossiping with my friends who by the meantime have come to visit us.

Next, upon landing, I decide to make a detour to my baby sister's house.  She happens to be home taking care of household regular chores while also attending to my 18 months old bubbly toddler of a niece. The latter is currently "experimenting" with new words building up her English vocabulary. She is a bit of late speaker. Hence, she has never uttered the word mommy quite intelligibly. 

It just so occurred that my sister decided to given me the temporary responsibility to baby sit my niece for a bit, as she went downstairs to the laundry room. We started playing a fun hide & seek game. As the vivacious princess hid behind the couch, her mom reentered the room. Upon hearing her mother's voice, my pretty excited niece leaped from behind the couch & blurted "look mommy come" assertively pointing at her rather surprised & melting mother. Did you just teach her how to say that? 

My mere back & forth session with this princess at the house created the quantum catalyst that helped the baby muster the necessary wherewithal to pull the words out of her awesome sponge of a fast growing brain sophistication.  Needless to say that the entire event made my day. Happy moments.

I was the only son of my parents and when I heard that I will have another sibling, I got very excited and I was counting days when this brother/ sister of mine will come. I speculated and imagined lots of things I would do with my sibling. The day that my sister came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.

For the first time, I felt a strong urge to kiss this little fairy child. She was so beautiful and adorable that I thanked God for the gift. My mother asked me to hold her and kiss her but I was afraid to touch her as I thought that might hurt her. I felt like I was flying on that day. My mother gave birth of the baby in a hospital and I was so happy and attached to the event that I denied returning home at night.

Many people take this week off from work and school to spend time with their families. The holidays are a good time to strengthen our connections and renew relationships. So turn off the cell phones, computers and televisions and take time to focus on your family.
  Research shows that families who spend time together are strong families. They communicate better and share a sense of belonging. Here are a few ideas you can try to spend time with your family.
     * Family game night. Spend at least one night during the holidays with the TV off and the family huddled together to play a favorite game. You may play cards, bingo or any other family favorite. Consider continuing this practice throughout the year and designate at least one night per week as family game night.
     * Go for a walk. After eating rich holiday foods, taking a walk provides not only time together but a great way to get some exercise.
     * Movie night. Rent a movie or watch a TV holiday special, pop some popcorn, and kick back for some family fun. Like game night, this may be something you'd like to continue throughout the year as a way to spend time together.
     * Play outdoors together. You can ride bikes, play ball, or go for a hike. It'll give the entire family some fresh air, exercise and great fun.
     * Go shopping. Hang out together while shopping at the after Christmas sales.
      * Cook together. Parents and kids can do the holiday baking and food preparation together. Even the youngest children can wash vegetables, set the table, or ice cookies.
     * Spend some one-on-one time with each child if you have more than one. Spending time alone provides time to bond with the child and helps him gain a sense of belonging and feeling of importance. It also provides an opportunity for the two of you to get to know each other better.
     * Since grandparents and older family members usually visit during the holidays, take time to share family customs and tell stories about past generations. Families build strength when they share family customs and traditions give family members a sense of belonging, and they strengthen values and beliefs. 
     One of the greatest gifts of the holiday season is the gift of time with family. Spend time together to strengthen relationships and to make wonderful family memories. Strong families spend time with each other - quality time in large quantities. So begin during the holidays and continue making time for each other throughout the year.

This birth was a water birth without pain meds of any sort. I kept thinking it was going to be worse than it was, or I wasnat capable of doing this thing called childbirth without medication like my last. But to my utter surprise, it wasnat and was far easier and less painful than my first! Even my dear husband and midwives were impressed with my pain tolerance and joy and laughter between contractions that were apparently off the charts.

But today I took him to the park to celebrate our birthdays.  He played for hours with a girl who has burn scars that cover most of her face.  When my son took a break to eat, he pointed to her and said, "She's so pretty and cool!"  Which left me thinking, "I must be doing something right as a mom."
I had outpatient surgery this morning where I needed someone to drive me home. My wife works night's so I didn't think she'd be at my appointment (I figured she'd get off of work about the time my appointment was finished). When I arrived to the Doctor's office, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my wife was already there waiting for me.

There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and out of those, I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with a little baby boy. This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.

My aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when the baby came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.

I usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying voice and then went near the baby. For the first time in my life, I felt a strong desire to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his little eyes. I thanked God for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.

My aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital.  This was a thrilling event for me.

Now I have a great attachment to him. His first word was my name. But that time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and that's why I cherish this memory very much
