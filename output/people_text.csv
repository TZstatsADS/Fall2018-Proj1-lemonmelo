There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesn't come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy. They maintain a positive outlook on life and remain at peace with themselves.

Existence is all mathematics,a he says. There's an equation for success in every obstacle.a

I strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.

Minimizing stress is a key issue in the frantic, changing 21st century world. People under stress are not alert to what is happening around them, and they are prone to oversights and mistakes.

Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority.

Staying in touch with friends and family is one of the top five regrets of the dying 7. If you want more evidence that itas beneficial for you, Iave found some research that proves it can make you happier right now.Social time is highly valuable when it comes to improving our happiness, even for introverts. Several studies have found that time spent with friends and family makes a big difference to how happy we feel, generally.
There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness does not come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy.

This aone happy momenta is described in more detail by Dryden and has the ability to keep out Time and Death, when they would seize us [the lovers]a which again illustrates the mystical powers of love (line 14). Personally, this idea seems very related to John Keatsa aOde on a Grecian Urn,a specifically his images of a man lusting after a woman: aShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, / For ever wilt thou love, and she be faira (Keats)! In Keatsa poem, the idea that love is everlasting and transcends time is present since he describes an image of a man and woman forever etched on a Grecian urn. In Drydenas love poem, he too writes about how this aone happy momenta has the ability to disregard time a the lovers are truly living in the moment.

They will hate you if you are beautiful. They will hate you if you are successful. They will hate you if you are right. They will hate you if you are popular. They will hate you when you get attention. They will hate you when people in their life like you. They will hate you if you worship a different version of their God. They will hate you if you are spiritual. They will hate you if you have courage. They will hate you if you have an opinion. They will hate you when people support you. They will hate you when they see you happy. Heck, they will hate you while they post prayers and religious quotes on Pinterest and Facebook. They just hate. However, remember this: They hate you because you represent something they feel they donat have. It really isn't about you. It is about the hatred they have for themselves. So smile today because there is something you are doing right that has a lot of people thinking about you.

Iave certainly found this to be true in my own life. Often, I donat even realize that an important event in my life has even happened, until some time has passed. For instance, I remember the minute I first laid eyes on my now-husband, but I didnt make a note of it. Or the moments when Iave had the ideas for all my books.

There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesn't come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy. They maintain a positive outlook on life and remain at peace with themselves.
The proposal was insanely ambitious-real people, alone or in groups, dance to the song, essentially creating an entire day's worth of music videos-and therefore riddled with creative challenges, which is like manna to Pharrell: "The best work comes from people who are motivated by crisis-when something stops the original idea, they respond by coming up with something even better. Existence is all mathematics," he says. "There's an equation for success in every obstacle."

strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.

Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority.

There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesn't come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy.

I'm happy, I would say that I'm one of the happiest people I know but I've certainly had periods of profound sadness, depression and heartache and those are the kind of things that are interesting to me to write about.

Two of them started making out on her shoulder, while one of them started eating her hair. They were chirping in her ears so loudly that she plugged her ears with her fingers. The birds didn't like this, so the bit her fingers! It was a sight to see, it was hilarious, to say the least!

The pursuit of happiness is so crucial that we try a lot of motivational strategies to make our employees productive. Happy employees tend to work efficiently and effectively since they emit positive energy, it is for this reason why they have to have proper compensation in order for them to enjoy and love their respective job. If the employee is in the state of being happy, he/she is thrice innovative. These 25 little things can really make them feel important and they'll be dedicated to their respective work.

I met someone. Initially I was excited because they were autistic like myself. But now I realize, I have felt falsely strong and projected.

There are so many mistakes I knew whilst making them. I am gleefully accepting of this time in my life with profound wisdom.

MY BEST FRIEND MARRIAGE PARTY
They will hate you if you are beautiful. They will hate you if you are successful. They will hate you if you are right. They will hate you if you are popular. They will hate you when you get attention. They will hate you when people in their life like you. They will hate you if you worship a different version of their God. They will hate you if you are spiritual. They will hate you if you have courage. They will hate you if you have an opinion. They will hate you when people support you. They will hate you when they see you happy. Heck, they will hate you while they post prayers and religious quotes on Pinterest and Facebook. They just hate. However, remember this: They hate you because you represent something they feel they don't have. It really isn't about you. It is about the hatred they have for themselves. So smile today because there is something you are doing right that has a lot of people thinking about you.

Everyone works at his own pace, so why compare yourself to others? If you think you're better than someone else, you gain an unhealthy sense of superiority. If you think someone else is better than you, you end up feeling bad about yourself. You'll be happier if you focus on your own progress and praise others on theirs.

Due to family events that took place before my birth, I have first cousins who I've never met. I have always thought how pathetic it is that I could literally be standing next to them without any idea we were related. Recently, I decided this was unacceptable and managed to track them down on Facebook. I was apprehensive about contacting them though, because I didn't want to cause more issues by accidentally bringing up the past. I finally contacted them and to my complete surprise, they both seemed really happy I messaged them. I've always wanted a close, tight-knit family but, for the most part, I have the complete opposite. Reading their replies, I felt really... hopeful and happy that I took the chance to reach out.

On every 14th February, all over the world,  candy, flowers, and gifts are given to loved ones all in the name of St. Valentine. According to other theories, in some countries it is related with commencement of spring, while in others it is celebrated as an agriculture festival.

Valentine's Day offers lovers many ways to express their emotions. Many people around the world celebrate Valentine's Day by showing appreciation for the people they love or adore. Many people give greeting cards, chocolates, jewelry or flowers, particularly roses, to their partners or admirers on Valentine's Day. It is also a time to appreciate friends in some social circles and cultures. So February 14th is the day to spread the love and exchange affectionate gifts to one another.

However, Valentine Day is gaining popularity among young lovers in the Asian countries also but it has been opposed by various Hindu and Islamic traditionalists. They consider it as a threat to the values and cultures of their society.

I've certainly found this to be true in my own life. Often, I don't even realize that an important event in my life has even happened, until some time has passed. For instance, I remember the minute I first laid eyes on my now-husband, but I didn't make a note of it. Or the moments when I've had the ideas for all my books.

Especially on my birthdays, my mom cooked my favorite foods and made my favorite birthday cake with chocolate. Now that I am not a teenager anymore, I go out with my friends and in some special circumstances with my family as well. For example, on my graduation day, I went to a Greek restaurant with my parents, brother and my five best friends and we had a really great time. Generally speaking, I would say that I am more of an introvert person, so I totally prefer to spend substantial time with few friends rather than having many people and typical relationships.

Answer a phone call from an old girl friend who invited me to visit her
The offsite with colleagues was great fun. We had stimulating discussions.
Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.

Most people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.

But I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.

Iave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.
She was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.

But just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.

I donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.

I remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.

The earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?

Iam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.

And then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a

Holy cow.

The joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a

I knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.

Since that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.

I think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.

In sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.

And Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.

Everyone has their own magical moments. For some of them, it can be a huge achievement, and for others, it may be a simple thing, which makes their day brighter. 

The greatest magical moment of mine is when I meet an old, dear friend, who I have not seen for a long time.  Firstly it is marvellous to notice differences in a friend's appearance and compare it with how he has looked in my memories and how he has changed since the last time we met.

Then I feel like a different person, because all wonderful memories flow in my mind and I can talk with my old friend about anything; we can share the best moments of our friendship or our plans for the future. During the meeting we cannot stop smiling and pouring positive emotions to each other. I feel crazily happy because we have finally met. This is obviously the main reason, why this moment is magical.

No matter what your magical moment is, if it makes you feel better, then it is your special thing.
