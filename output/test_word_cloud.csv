I had a great meeting yesterday at work with my boss and a few colleagues and we went out for lunch afterward; everybody was excited by the projects we're working on and how efficient our team is.
This maid of mine who comes to wash dishes at home is usually late. This morning I was in a hurry to go to the bank for some important work. Well what do you know! The maid came right on time. The dishes were cleaned. I did not want to come home to a mess.
